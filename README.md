<br><strong> Hello Hello!</strong>

<br><br>Hello my name is KriShauna Fisher and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python with a focous on web development. Before becoming a software engineer I worked under a goverment contract for the Stare of Michigan but wanted to get into a field that more in depth with the tech industry. I love that this field can be just as creative as it is challenging.
